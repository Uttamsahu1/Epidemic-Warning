## 📌 Overview

**EpiWatch** is a machine learning web application that monitors real-time epidemic trends across 195+ countries and predicts disease spread before outbreaks escalate. It classifies countries into three alert levels — 🟢 Low Risk, 🟡 Medium Risk, and 🔴 High Risk — enabling public health authorities to respond early.

Built for the **CodeCure AI Hackathon 2026 — Track C (Epidemic Spread Prediction)**.

## 🖥️ App Preview

| Overview | Country Analysis | Forecast | Risk Alerts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global KPI dashboard with risk distribution charts | Per-country case trend, daily cases & deaths | 30-day ML forecast with confidence bands | 🔴 High / 🟡 Medium alert tables with country search |

---

## ✨ Features

- **Overview Dashboard** — Total confirmed cases, country-level risk distribution, top 10 countries by case count and growth rate
- **Country Analysis** — Deep-dive trend charts for any country — cumulative cases, daily new cases, and death trajectory
- **30-Day Forecast** — Ridge Regression ML model with lag features, rolling averages, and confidence bands
- **Risk Alert System** — Real-time 🔴 HIGH / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW classification based on 7-day growth rate
- **Professional Dark UI** — Custom CSS injection for a polished, production-grade Streamlit interface

## 📊 Dataset

**Primary Dataset:** [Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 Time Series](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Loaded directly via URL — no manual download required.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Countries Tracked | 195+ |
| Date Range | Jan 2020 → Mar 2023 |
| Data Format | Daily time-series CSV |
| Source | Johns Hopkins CSSE |

**Features engineered:**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `Daily_Cases` | New cases per day (diff of cumulative) |
| `Daily_Deaths` | New deaths per day |
| `Rolling_7day` | 7-day rolling average (smoothed trend) |
| `Growth_Rate` | % change in rolling average over 7 days |
| `Doubling_Time` | Days until cases double at current rate |
| `Risk_Level` | 🔴 HIGH / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW classification |

---

## 🤖 ML Model

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Algorithm | Ridge Regression |
| Framework | scikit-learn Pipeline + StandardScaler |
| Forecast Horizon | Up to 60 days |
| Confidence Band | ±30% around prediction |

**Lag features used for forecasting:**

```python
Features = ["Day", "Lag1", "Lag7", "Lag14", "Roll7", "Roll14", "DayOfWeek", "Month"]
```

---

## 🚨 Risk Level Classification

| Level | Label | Condition | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 | **Low Risk** | Growth Rate < 5% | Stable — no significant outbreak signal |
| 🟡 | **Medium Risk** | Growth Rate 5–20% | Elevated transmission — enhanced surveillance needed |
| 🔴 | **High Risk** | Growth Rate ≥ 20% | Critical outbreak — immediate intervention required |
